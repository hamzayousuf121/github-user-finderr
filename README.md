Please find the small assignment below, that we would like for you to complete in the allotted time. (If you are reading this, the clock is already ticking).

## YOUR TASK: Create an app that fetches (public) user gists from Github

This project should be built using the base project you should clone from [here](https://github.com/Tresmindsolutions/gist-api).

It uses Github's [Octokit REST API](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v18/)

We believe, for an ideal candidate, this should not take more than a couple of hours.

### Whats Expected

Create a list of public gist available.

- Search Gists for the username.
- Use state management to save data and not make duplicate calls.
- Show all the relevant meta data available in the response.
- We do expect you to create and use proper component hierarchy keeping service and components exclusive.
- Please use git version control.

### Good to have

- Proper handling of error message and no results screens.
- Clean UI similar to [this](https://ibb.co/CvwYvnv).
- Unit Tests.
- Optimised rendering.
- Code comments.
- Type checking of the params.

### Thank you

We thank you for your effort and time and good luck.
